# SCNMathExtensions

SCNMathExtensions is a Swift micro-library that provides commonplace math extensions for SceneKit's `SCNVector3`, `SCNQuaternion`, & `SCNMatrix4` types, and bridging from/to `GLKVector3`, `simd.float3`, `GLKQuaternion`, `GLKMatrix4`, & `simd.float4x4`.

The master branch is Swift 5.x, and build overlays (the minimal changeset to the Package.swift, xcodeproj, and other build files) of the current library version are available on the [swift-4.2](https://github.com/capnslipp/SCNMathExtensions/tree/swift-4.2), [swift-4](https://github.com/capnslipp/SCNMathExtensions/tree/swift-4), and [swift-3](https://github.com/capnslipp/SCNMathExtensions/tree/swift-3) branches.  _(Note: I don't check that these are built as often as I used to when Swift 4.2 or 4.0 were the latest versions, but their changes haved worked and I've merged new library versions into them since then.)_
